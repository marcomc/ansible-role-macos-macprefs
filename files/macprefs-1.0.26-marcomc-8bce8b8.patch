+
+This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
+published from being rewound.
+
+The workflow assumed here is:
+
+ * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
+   merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).
+
+ * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
+   it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
+   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
+   the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
+   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.
+
+ * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
+   branches, merge them into "next" branch.
+
+The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
+to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
+$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.
+
+With this workflow, you would want to know:
+
+(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
+    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
+    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
+    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
+    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
+    not want to rewind it.
+
+(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
+    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
+    build on top of it -- other people may already want to
+    change things related to the topic as patches against your
+    "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
+    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
+    tip of "master".
+
+Let's look at this example:
+
+		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
+		  /       /           /           /
+		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
+		/   /               /           /
+	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
+	      /   /   /             \         /
+	     /   /   /   b---b C     \       /
+	    /   /   /   /             \     /
+    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"
+
+
+A, B and C are topic branches.
+
+ * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".
+
+ * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
+   and is ready to be deleted.
+
+ * C has not merged to "next" at all.
+
+We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
+B to be deleted.
+
+To compute (1):
+
+	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
+	git rev-list ^master        next
+
+	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.
+
+To compute (2):
+
+	git rev-list master..topic
+
+	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".
